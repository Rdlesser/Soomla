# Soomla
This project is Soomla's home assignment, demonstrating the capabilities of Facebook ad manipulation and Java's reflection.


The app displays a 'show banner' button.
Upon a click event of the button:
  - A test banner is loaded on the screen
  - The banner's icon is changed using Javascript 
  - The 'install' button's href is also changed using Javascript 
* Multiple clicks create multiple ads with random icons and 'install' links

NOTE:
  - To clear out the screen from ads just rotate phone =)
  
  
HOPE YOU ENJOY!
